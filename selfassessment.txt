In this lab we divided work into one person working on an additional sparse data format, while the other two worked on the two parallel variants. We then worked on the writeup together.

Point distrbution:
40% - Mark
40% - Lexie
20% - Quinten

How did your original statement of work line up with what was
done? How did it evolve? How much time (and/or effort) did this take? How was the time
(and/or effort) distributed across the task and team members? 

Our original statement of work lined up mostly with what we originally intended. 

Person-hours:
Lexie 6 hours
Mark 6 hours
Quentin 2 hours
